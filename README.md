# Cat Dog Classification 
This is a simple program for cat dog classification that I have made for one of the courses I took in my university in 2021. In order for program to work properly, file paths need to be changed depending on where you store the data. The program gets all the labeled data from the dataset that needs to be pre-installed and trains them using convolutional neural networks. User can either upload a picture or make the program to get a random picture in dataset then the program makes a prediction whether it is a cat or dog. It has a 85% accuracy rate which is fine. 
The dataset used in this program is provided by kaggle.com and is accessible here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
